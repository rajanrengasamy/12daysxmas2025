# UI: Paper/Parchment Texture Overlay

## Prompt (copy this)

```
Subtle aged paper parchment texture, Studio Ghibli watercolor style, warm cream and ivory base with gentle variations, soft water stain marks and subtle discoloration, delicate fiber texture visible, hand-made paper aesthetic, slight vignette darker edges, nostalgic vintage letter paper feel, very subtle texture not overwhelming, seamless tileable pattern preferred, warm golden undertones, dreamy soft aged quality
```

## Settings

- **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 (square, tileable) or 16:9 (full background)
- **Save as:** `ui-paper-texture.png`

## Note

This is optional - can be overlaid on top of other elements to give a unified hand-painted paper feel across all assets.
