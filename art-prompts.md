## Generation Workflow Recommendations

### Batch Generation Strategy

1. **Backgrounds First:** Generate all 4 backgrounds, selecting best from 3-4 attempts each
2. **Doors as Set:** Generate doors in batches to maintain style consistency
3. **UI Elements Last:** These are smallest and most flexible

### Quality Control Checklist

For each generated image, verify:
- [ ] Warm color temperature (not cool/blue)
- [ ] Visible brush stroke texture
- [ ] Soft, dreamy atmosphere
- [ ] No unwanted people/characters
- [ ] Consistent style across set
- [ ] Appropriate resolution for use case

### Post-Processing Suggestions

- **Color Correction:** Warm up any images that skew cool
- **Texture Overlay:** Add consistent paper texture across all assets
- **Vignette:** Subtle darkening at edges unifies the set
- **Noise/Grain:** Light film grain adds to hand-painted feel
