# 12 Days of Christmas Poems

---

## 1. The Thread Between Us
*Friendship*

Some friends arrive like summer storms,
loud and bright and gone too soon.
But you came quiet as morning light,
and stayed through every afternoon.

We've worn each other's silence well,
found comfort in the in-between.
The truest friends don't fill the space—
they make it soft, and warm, and clean.

---

## 2. The Small Hours
*Love*

I loved you most at 2 AM,
when sleep had stripped away pretense,
and we were just two tangled hearts
speaking without consequence.

In daylight we are many things,
but there, beneath the dimming stars,
we're simply us—unpolished, true,
with all our edges, all our scars.

---

## 3. Golden Hours
*Time Together*

Remember how the afternoon
stretched long like honey in the sun?
We thought we had forever then,
not knowing it had just begun.

Now I collect these scattered hours
like sea glass from a fading shore,
each ordinary moment held
more precious than the one before.

---

## 4. Winter's Gentle Spell
*Holidays*

There's magic in the early dark,
in frost that etches windowpanes,
in kitchens warm with cinnamon
while cold December taps the glass like rain.

We gather close when daylight fades,
our laughter soft as falling snow.
The world grows small and safe and bright—
these are the nights that make us glow.

---

## 5. What I Meant to Say
*Gratitude*

I've written thank-you notes in my head
a thousand times or maybe more,
for showing up when I could not,
for knocking on my stubborn door.

You didn't ask for anything,
just brought your presence, warm and true.
I'm still not sure I've said it right:
I'm different now because of you.

---

## 6. The Kitchen Table
*Family*

This table holds a thousand meals,
a hundred arguments now healed,
the weight of elbows, spilled milk, tears,
and all the love we tried to shield.

We are not perfect, never were,
but here we always find our way.
The cracks between us fill with light—
that's family, I think, anyway.

---

## 7. The Path We've Worn
*Life's Journey*

We've walked so far from where we started,
past versions of ourselves now gone.
I see them sometimes in old photos—
those hopeful strangers, moving on.

And here we are, a little worn,
with laugh lines earned and stories told.
The road ahead grows soft with mist,
but I'm not scared of growing old.

---

## 8. What the Fireflies Knew
*Meaning of Life*

The fireflies don't ask for meaning,
they simply glow and find each other.
Perhaps that's all we're meant to do:
shine gently, warm another.

The rest is noise and worry,
the chasing after wind.
But sitting here beside you now,
I think I finally understand.

---

## 9. The Ridiculous Sacred
*Laughter*

You've seen me laugh until I couldn't breathe,
over nothing, over everything.
Those moments live somewhere between
the sacred and the silly thing.

I'd trade a thousand serious hours
for one more helpless, tear-streaked night,
when joy broke through our careful walls
and everything felt weightless, light.

---

## 10. Somewhere We've Never Been
*Adventure*

We've chased the sun through unknown towns,
slept in cars, got beautifully lost.
The best adventures had no plans,
just wonder, and a coin to toss.

I don't remember every road,
but I remember how it felt—
that anything could happen next,
the way the unknown made us melt.

---

## 11. When the World Went Dark
*Support*

You didn't try to fix the dark,
you simply sat with me inside it.
You didn't promise dawn would come,
just held my hand and didn't hide it.

Some kindnesses don't need a name,
they're just the staying, just the showing.
And when I finally found the light,
I found you there, still softly glowing.

---

## 12. Not the End
*Hope*

This is not goodbye, my dear,
just a pause between the pages.
The story isn't finished yet—
we're writing it for ages.

So pour another cup of warmth,
and let the future gently wait.
The best of us is yet to come,
and darling, it's not too late.

---

*May these twelve days remind us:*
*the smallest moments hold the most.*
